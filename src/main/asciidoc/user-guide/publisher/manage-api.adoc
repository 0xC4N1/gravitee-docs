== I'm an API publisher
This section provides help to manage and configure your APIs, starting from the creation of an API,
working with technical configuration (endpoint, load-balancing, health-check) and providing documentation
to developers.

=== Manage APIs

As we've seen in the <<gravitee-quickstart, quick start>> section, you can easily create a new API from scratch.

By clicking the (+) button at the bottom of the portal page, you may see that there are some other ways to create an API:

==== Create an empty API
This option lets you to create an API from scratch, meaning that you have to configure your API correctly (name, version,
context-path, backend endpoints, ...) before publishing it to developers.

To understand how to create an API from scratch, please follow the <<gravitee-quickstart, quick start guide>>.

==== Import an existing API definition
NOTE: To complete

==== Import a Swagger descriptor
One of the amazing feature of Gravitee.io is the ability to import a Swagger descriptor to create an API. By doing so,
you do not have to complete all the fields required when you're creating a new API from scratch.
Finally, the only thing you have to do is to specify a context-path to expose the API.

.Step1: Import a Swagger descriptor

.Step2: Change values from the Swagger descriptor if required

.Step3: Set the context-path

Now you can navigate to the policies management view, and you will see that all route declared in the Swagger descriptor
 are automatically created in Gravitee.io

.Step3: Good job guy !

=== Plans and subscriptions


=== Manage members

When the API is defined as a private API, no one can access it through the portal and, as a consequence, no one can
subscribe to the API.

Even if the API is private, you can still give access to some users by managing members of the API.

By default, Gravitee.io is defining three roles for membership:

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
^|Role
^|Description

.^| *Primary owner*
.^| When an API is created, the primary owner is the creator of the API. Primary owner can do all possible actions for an API.

.^| *Owner*
.^| Owner is a lightest version of the primary owner role. Owner is not able to change the context-path of the API and not delete it.

.^| *User*
.^| A user is a person who can access the API and subscribe to it through a plan.

|===

=== Publish documentation

Documentation is the key for a successful API.
At this date, Gravitee.io is supporting three types of document:

* Swagger
* RAML
* Markdown (MD)
