A popular trend in enterprise software development these days is to design very decoupled applications connected via APIs. 
This approach provides an excellent way to reuse functionality across various applications and business units no matter what the implementation technology is.

However, this approach also introduces its own pitfalls and disadvantages including :

* Difficulty discovering or sharing existing APIs
* Difficulty sharing common functionality across API implementations
* Tracking API usage/consumption

API Management enables you to create, manage, secure, track and sharing your APIs by providing tools like API Manager, as well as an API Gateway to direct API traffic by applying policies and API's configurations. API management system tends to provide the following features :

* Centralized governance policy configuration
* Tracking APIs and API consumers
* Easy sharing and discovery APIs
* Leveraging common policy configuration across different APIs

== Gravitee.io
Gravitee.io is a flexible, lightweight and blazing-fast open source API Management solution that helps you and your organizations to control finely who, when and how users access your APIs. Gravitee.io is not only a product, it acts as a global solution for API Management.

[[why-gravitee-io]]
=== Why Gravitee.io ?
At the very beginning, we were searching for an open-source solution to do API Management. Unfortunately, we've never found
the tool which fit exactly our needs and by choosing one of them we know that we have to pull other components and,
for some of them use a dedicated support.

That's the main reason why we launch Gravitee.io : our goal is to provide you an highly integrable solution which
is able to fit perfectly your infrastructure and your business needs.

Also, Gravitee.io has been developed and designed to be fully extensible using its internal plugin system. You must be
able to do whatever you want : defining your own policy, developing your own reporting system, and so on...

Finally, all components provided by Gravitee.io (including gateway and management-api) are really lightweight. We
took an aggressive approach to CPU and memory management. This makes things really easier for you in terms of high-availability
and our components can be started in a "blazing-fast" mode (generally speaking, it takes less than 5 seconds for the gateway
to be accessible to consumers, depending on the number of APIs to deploy).

You see no constraint using Gravitee.io at all ? Sounds good ! So let's go further with Gravitee.io right now !

=== Architecture Overview
Before going further with Gravitee.io, you have to read this section to get a better understanding of the concepts you need
to know to go ahead quickly.

=== API
An API is the main entity defined and used by Gravitee.io. You can see it as a starting point to expose services through the gateway. One (or more) endpoint is defined into the gateway section of the API to point on the backend which will be consumed by the gateway.

=== Gateway
The core component of the Gravitee.io solution. You can just compare it to an HTTP proxy to understand
its goal. But in comparison to these proxies, our gateway is applying rules (ie. <<gravitee-policies, policies>>) to
both HTTP requests and responses according to your needs.

=== Management API
RESTful API providing a bunch of services to manage the platform globally. All exposed
services are constraint by authentication and authorization rules.
You can find more information by having a look to the <<gravitee-management-api-overview, Management API>> section.

=== Management UI
This is the Web UI client of Gravitee.io Management API. The Management UI offers the same features as the Management API such as API management, application management, user management, analytics dashboard.

[[gravitee-plugins]]
=== Plugins
_Plugins_ are additional components that can be _plugged into_ the Gateway and / or the Management API.
_Plugins_ can specialized these component's behavior to exactly fit your needs and your technical constraints.
They follow a given directory structure convention, look at the <<gravitee-dev-guide-overview, Developer Guide>>
to have more information about it.

During your Gravitee.io usage, you must encounter several types of _plugins_ which are:

[width="100%",cols="^3,^3,^10",options="header"]
|===
|Type|Components|Examples
| <<gravitee-repositories, Identity Provider>>|Management API|LDAP, Oauth2, InMemory, ...
| <<gravitee-policies, Policies>>|Management API / Gateway|API Key, Rate-limiting, Cache, ...
| <<gravitee-reporters, Reporters>>|Gateway|Elasticsearch, Accesslog, ...
| <<gravitee-repositories, Repositories>>|Management API / Gateway|MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, ...
| <<gravitee-resources, Resources>>|Management API / Gateway|Oauth2, Cache, LDAP, ...
| <<gravitee-repositories, Services>>|Gateway|Sync, local registry, healthcheck, monitor, ...
|===

[[gravitee-policies]]
==== Policies
A *policy* is acting as a behavior to apply to the request and / or response handled by the _gateway_ and can be chained by a request policy chain or a response policy chain using a logical order.
Policy can be treated like a _proxy controller_ by guaranteeing if a given business rule is fulfilled during request / response processing.

Good examples for a policy are:

* Authorization using an API key (see the <<policy-apikey ,api-key policy>>)
* Applying CORS filters
* Applying rate limiting or quota to avoid API flooding.

Want to know how to create, use, and deploy a custom policy? Check out the  <<gravitee-dev-guide-overview, Developer Guide>>!

[[gravitee-reporters]]
==== Reporters

A *reporter* is used by gateway instance to report many types of event:

* Requests/responses metrics : response-time, content-length, api-key, ...
* Monitoring metrics: CPU, Heap usage, ...

"Out of the box" reporters are :

* ElasticSearch Engine Reporter
* File Reporter

Like any other plugin you can create, use, and deploy a custom reporter thanks to the <<gravitee-dev-guide-overview, Developer Guide>>!

[[gravitee-repositories]]
==== Repositories
Pluggable storage component for APIs' configurations, policies configurations, analytics and so on.
You can find more information by having a look to the <<gravitee-management-api-repository, Management API : Repository>> section.
